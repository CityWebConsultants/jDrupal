## 1. Set up a Drupal 8 Website

To build an application, we first need a Drupal 8 website. For simplicity, we'll want our Drupal 8 website to be available online. This means, we should be able to access the website using the web browser on a mobile device.

Chances are if you are reading this, you already have a Drupal website online (or several). If that is the case, go ahead and jump to step #2. If you are new to Drupal, don't worry, there are plenty of great resources on getting a Drupal 8 website up and running.

 - [Download Drupal](https://drupal.org/download)
 - [Install Drupal](http://drupal.org/documentation/install)

## 2. Enable the jDrupal Module

For our app to communicate with Drupal, the [jDrupal module](http://www.drupal.org/project/jdrupal) needs to be enabled.

```
drush en jdrupal
```

## 3. Done!

We're now ready to build an application! If you haven't already, we'd recommend completing the [Hello World](Hello_World) for jDrupal next.
